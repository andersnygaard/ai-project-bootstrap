# Scan Project

Autonomous project scanner that analyzes your codebase from multiple angles and generates actionable tasks.

**PLANNING ONLY — NO IMPLEMENTATION**
This skill creates task files via the `task-board` skill. It does NOT write code.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Spec vs Implementation gap analysis** — compares `.docs/specs.md` against actual code to find missing or incomplete features
2. **Code quality & readability review** — finds bottlenecks, code smells, and readability issues
3. **Best practices audit** — checks for consistent patterns, naming, error handling, test quality
4. **Task generation** — produces 3 prioritized, actionable tasks per scan round

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when**:
- Starting a new development phase
- Backlog is stale or empty
- Want to discover gaps between spec and implementation
- Need to find bottlenecks or performance issues
- Want a code quality and readability audit
- Looking for changes that could improve readability or maintainability
- Need a best practices review
- Running `/scan-project` slash command

**DO NOT use this skill for**:
- Creating a single specific task -> use `task-board` skill directly
- Implementing tasks -> this skill only discovers and plans
- Quick bug fixes -> just fix them directly

## Scan Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Context

Before any analysis, load ALL context:

1. **Read specification**: `.docs/specs.md` completely
2. **Read project instructions**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. **Scan completed tasks**: `.task-board/done/` (learn what's already done)
4. **Scan existing backlog**: `.task-board/backlog/` + `.task-board/in-progress/` + `.task-board/on-hold/`
5. **Note available skills**: Check `.claude/skills/` for delegation

### Phase 2: Spec vs Implementation Gap Analysis

**Goal**: Produce a comprehensive gap report by comparing `.docs/specs.md` against the actual codebase.

Use a **subagent** (Agent tool, model: `sonnet`) to perform this analysis. The subagent should:

1. **Read `.docs/specs.md`** end-to-end and extract every specified feature, interface, model, behavior, and non-functional requirement into a checklist.

2. **Scan all source code** — list every source file, read key files, and map what exists:
   - Classes, modules, components, functions
   - Key interfaces and their implementations
   - Test files and what they cover
   - TODOs, FIXMEs, HACK comments

3. **Build a Spec Coverage Matrix** — for each item from the spec, mark its status:

   | Spec Item | Status | Evidence |
   |-----------|--------|----------|
   | Feature X | Implemented / Partial / Missing / N/A | File path or note |

   Categories to cover:
   - Core features listed in the spec
   - Architecture layers and components
   - Interfaces and contracts specified
   - Test coverage specified
   - Non-functional requirements (readability, conventions, etc.)

4. **Return the matrix** and a summary of the top gaps, ordered by impact.

### Phase 3: Code Quality, Readability & Best Practices Review

**Goal**: Evaluate existing code for quality, readability, and adherence to best practices. Find opportunities to make the code better.

**Readability & Style**:
- Descriptive names — no abbreviations, consistent casing
- Small, focused, single-purpose methods/functions
- Self-documenting code — reads like prose, comments only for "why"
- Consistent style — one way of doing things throughout the project

**Architecture & Design**:
- SOLID principles — single responsibility, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Appropriate use of abstractions — not too many, not too few
- Dependency management — no circular dependencies, clean import structure

**Bottlenecks & Performance**:
- N+1 queries or unnecessary repeated operations
- Missing caching where beneficial
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Resource leaks (unclosed connections, streams, etc.)

**Error Handling & Robustness**:
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- Meaningful error messages
- No swallowed exceptions or silent failures

**Test Quality**:
- Clear structure (Arrange-Act-Assert or equivalent)
- Descriptive test names
- Focused assertions — one concern per test
- Coverage of edge cases and error paths

**Code Smells**:
- Magic strings/numbers
- God classes or functions doing too much
- Long parameter lists
- Deep nesting
- Duplicated logic that should be extracted

### Phase 4: Task Generation (3 tasks per round)

From the gaps and quality issues found, select the **3 most impactful tasks**.

**Selection criteria** (prioritize in order):
1. **Blocking dependencies first**: Infrastructure/foundation that other features need
2. **Spec gaps over quality**: Missing features before polish
3. **High impact, right size**: Not epic-sized, not trivial
4. **Progressive**: Build on what exists, don't leap ahead

**Quality bar** (ALL must be met):
- Clear value: Obvious benefit or spec alignment
- Well-scoped: Completable in one focused session
- Actionable: Can implement without major unknowns
- Non-redundant: Not covered by existing task

**For each of the 3 tasks**:
1. Invoke `task-board` skill with full context
2. Include: what it addresses (spec gap, quality issue, bottleneck), why it's prioritized now, technical approach hints
3. Assign sequential number (scan ALL `.task-board/**/*.md` for highest existing number)

**Task file format requirements**:
- Acceptance criteria MUST appear at the bottom of the task file as checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
- All code changes MUST be represented with **before and after examples** in the Technical Approach section

### Phase 5: Update Planning Board

After creating tasks, update `.task-board/PLANNING-BOARD.md` with:
- Current top 3 priorities (the tasks just created)
- Any recently completed work from `done/`
- Current focus area

## Numbering Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Never reuse numbers.

```
1. Glob: .task-board/**/*.md
2. Scan ALL folders: backlog/ + in-progress/ + done/ + on-hold/
3. Find highest number
4. Next task = highest + 1
```

File format: `NNN-TYPE-description.md`
- `001-FEATURE-project-scaffolding.md`
- `002-REFACTOR-naming-consistency.md`
- `003-QUALITY-test-coverage.md`

## Output

Summary report with:
- Spec coverage overview (X of Y spec items implemented)
- Top code quality and readability findings
- Bottlenecks or best practice violations found
- 3 tasks created (number, type, title, priority)
- Recommended implementation order
- What to focus on in the next scan round
